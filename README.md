I can call myself the “old guard” of software development, yet always open to change. I have years of practical experience with different technology. I keep improving my skills on a daily basis and learning new tricks “on-site” as I solve the problems of an ongoing successful business. I feel the pains of an IT business and at the same time understand know all ins and outs of software development. My motto is, ‘Never say “I can't,” rather “Give me some more time"’.<br/>
